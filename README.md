# 2-Stage-Loan-Approval-Valuation-System
This project is a real-world, end-to-end Machine Learning application that simulates how financial institutions evaluate loan applications. It uses a two-stage modeling approach where the first model decides whether a loan should be approved or rejected, and the second model predicts the optimal loan amount for approved applicants.
